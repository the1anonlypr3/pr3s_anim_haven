<h1>// welcome to my anim haven!</h1>
<p>basically my little github corner to show off my artwork, specifically flipper animations!</p>

<h1>// a bit about this repo and how it came to be..</h1>
<p>on the 15th of september, 2024, i joined the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/momentum">momentumFW discord</a>, flipperless lmao. chilled around, and always wanted to make assets/animations for said flipper (which i got a while later) starting on ms paint, i messed around on <a href="https://ezgif.com/">ezGIF</a> til i understood the flow of making animations! a couple giveaway wins, firmware contributions and new friends later, i created this repo! (which im deciding to make pretty at 8pm on a friday) anyways, enough about me, enjoy my creations!</p>

<h1>// this repo wouldn't exist without some people..</h1>
<li>my half babysitter/mentor, <a href="https://github.com/kuronons">kuronons</a>, was the one that kicked off the idea of this repo along with teaching me a lot of things about art in general that are invaluable to me to this day. i'll forever hold his teachings in my creations and my ❤️.</li>
<li>blepdoge, the champion that dm'd me aseprite portable one day LMFAO (legally feds..) without him, my art wouldn't be anywhere near where it is today. aseprite helps me out so so much oh my days</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TalkingSasquach">talkingsasquach</a>, the goat that originally orignally taught how asset packs work (with his amazing videos!)</li>

<h1>// that's about it! thank you so much for checking out my repo! <3</h1>
