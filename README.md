<p>listed in this repo will be some anims i make over my journey of learning and finding my place in the Flipper community. <strong>IMMENSE</strong> thank you to <a href="https://github.com/Kuronons">Kuronons</a> for inspiring me not only to make this repo alone, but to start animating in the first place! cannot thank you enough. </p>
 # for the record, kuronons' anim repo is <a href="https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/tree/bb6d0800f3a0c6c03cab904165bc54ed3db59fe7">here!</a>
<p>can't wait to see how my own skills evolve, and maybe whether i become an actual <i>artist</i> or not!</p>

<h5>side note: as of some time before 3/10/24, i am making all anims from scratch frame by frame in ms paint. </h5>

<h3>thanks for reading, and goodbye. :)</h3>
